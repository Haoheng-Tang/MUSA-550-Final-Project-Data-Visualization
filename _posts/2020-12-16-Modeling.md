This post shows the process of modeling, including regression analysis and model assessment.

## Regression analysis

The correlation matrix below shows the correlations between one viriable and another.

The chart below shows the importance of each feature in regression.

Both of the figures above show that 1-week time lag and 1-day time lag are super important in regression. Obviously, the occupancy a day or a week before strongly indicates the occupancy one day. 1-week time lag is more important than 1-day time lag because weekday also influences the occupancy of parking spaces.

## Model Assessment

The predictions have high value of error at Saturday, probably because the occupancy on Saturday is the lowest in a week. This also reflects that the model is not very generalizable in time.

Parking occupancy on Nov 26 is extremely low, while prediction is still high. The low occupancy rate that day is probably due to Thanksgiving.
